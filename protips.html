    <h2>Pro Tips for Your Fitness Journey</h2>
    <p>
      At FitStance, we believe fitness is not about quick fixes but about building strong, sustainable habits. 
      This page is designed to give you detailed, science-backed advice that covers training, nutrition, 
      and lifestyle. These tips go beyond a single workout or diet plan and instead focus on the everyday 
      actions that create long-term transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you are just starting out or already experienced in fitness, these strategies will help you 
      train smarter, fuel your body better, recover effectively, and stay consistent. Apply them daily, 
      connect them with your workouts and diet plans, and you will begin to see not only physical 
      progress but also improvements in energy, confidence, and overall well-being.
    </p>

    <!-- Training Tips -->
    <h2>Training Tips</h2>
    <p>
      A proper warm-up is one of the most underrated steps in training. Before lifting or intense cardio, 
      spend 5–10 minutes doing mobility drills and dynamic stretches. This prepares your muscles, reduces 
      the risk of injury, and helps you perform better during your workout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Progressive overload is the key to building strength and muscle. Gradually increase weight, 
      repetitions, or intensity over time so that your body continues to adapt. Remember, slow and steady 
      progress is far better than rushing and risking injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovery is just as important as training itself. Without enough rest, your body cannot rebuild 
      and grow stronger. Ensure you have at least one or two rest days every week and listen to your 
      body’s signals to avoid overtraining.
    </p>

    <!-- Nutrition Tips -->
    <h2>Nutrition Tips</h2>
    <p>
      Protein is the foundation of a healthy diet when it comes to building muscle and aiding recovery. 
      Include lean protein sources throughout the day to support your goals. Carbohydrates fuel your 
      workouts and recovery, while healthy fats keep your hormones and brain function in balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hydration is often overlooked but essential. Even slight dehydration can reduce performance, 
      impact recovery, and affect mood. Keep water with you throughout the day and increase your 
      intake during hot weather or intense training sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portion control and balance matter. You don’t have to eliminate your favorite foods, but learning 
      how to manage serving sizes and focusing on whole, nutrient-dense meals will keep your results 
      consistent and sustainable.
    </p>

    <!-- Lifestyle Tips -->
    <h2>Lifestyle & Recovery Tips</h2>
    <p>
      Quality sleep is one of the most powerful recovery tools. Aim for 7–9 hours each night to allow 
      your body to repair, grow, and reset. Poor sleep can affect everything from fat loss and 
      muscle gain to your mood and decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stress management is vital for fitness. High stress raises cortisol levels, which can slow down 
      fat loss and recovery. Incorporate practices like meditation, journaling, or simply taking breaks 
      to recharge your mind and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily movement outside the gym counts more than you think. Walking, climbing stairs, or even 
      light household activity keeps your metabolism active and adds up to better long-term results. 
      Consistency always beats perfection.
    </p>

    <!-- Highlight Box -->
    <div class="highlight-box">
      Golden Rule: Fitness is built on small, consistent actions. One workout or one meal won’t 
      change your body, but repeating them daily will.
    </div>

    <!-- Closing Motivation -->
    <h2>Stay Committed</h2>
    <p>
      Your journey is unique—don’t compare it with anyone else’s. Trust the process, stay patient, 
      and remember that progress takes time. Focus on building habits that you can follow for years, 
      not just weeks. Fitness is a lifestyle, not a temporary phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apply these pro tips along with the tools, workout routines, and diet plans provided across 
      FitStance, and you will have everything you need to achieve your goals with confidence.
